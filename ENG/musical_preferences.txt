I don't want to share my musical preferences and especially explain them.
There are many reasons why.

First of all each of us have different life experience. Music isn't about notes, but about feelings and our inner state. Not only various people perceive one song differently, but one man in different mood. Because of it attitude to song can not be shared properly.

Secondly musical preferences is very personal thing for me. Even neighbors which had been living with me for 3 years, don't know about my favorite songs. Maybe it's because of my introversion or maybe I just haven't favorite music compositions.

Last, but not least reason is technical. If someone asks me to share some songs I open my playlist and try to find song or songs that will satisfy him. But when I deleted from vk I lost access to my playlist. That's why even if I wanted I couldn't easily find songs to share.
