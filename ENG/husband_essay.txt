I think that Amy and her husband were poorly brought up. She is typical modern woman which has no concept of respect. She has chosen her husband because he is weak, unsure of himself and it's easy to manipulate him. Had he been a real man it would not have been necessary to train him, he would have developed their own.

I would like to train only my future dog, because dogs are smart, faithful and kind. I have been coaching students for 3 years and realized that it's thankless job to train people. Good people are good by themselves and there is no need to train them in adulthood.

I think that the most useful trick is show by example. Other techniques presented in the text are just manipulating of base instincts and it's very pity that they work on present people. As a conclusion, I want to say, "be strong, be smart."
